 returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:

grid is a list of list of integers:
0 represents a water zone
1 represents a land zone
One cell is a square with side length 1
Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
Grid is rectangular, width and height donâ€™t exceed 100
